		<h1>Welcome to MYP Science and Physics at GIS</h1>
		<p class="lead">Science, from the latin word <i>scientia</i>, or knowledge, is the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through empirical evidence, that is from observation and experimentation.</p>
		<p class="lead">Physics is the most fundamental of sciences, as it aims to provide answers about the nature of the building blocks of the Universe, what they are and how they behave. Research in Physics has laid the ground work for the development of most technologies and continues to be a driving force in shaping what our everyday lives look like. </p>
