Today we continued to work on our very first lab! Students learned about the formula for the position of an object in uniformly accelerated motion. Then proceeded to try to determine
the acceleration of free fall by filming balls free fallin from different heights. The class went over two ways of calculating the Acceleration
of free fall give the height and time of travel.
